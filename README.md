<h1 align = center >PONG GAME</h1>


<p>This project implements a classic Pong game using Python and the Pygame library. The game consists of two paddles controlled by players and a ball that bounces off the paddles and screen boundaries. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game features smooth movement, collision detection, and a simple scoring system. </p>
